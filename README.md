# even-chan (エヴァンちゃん)

This is a Discord bot that Evan runs on the public `vEnhance` server that will
grab problems from well-known contests and print their statements, AoPS links,
and authors, if known. It pulls directly from Evan's database, so there may be
gaps and weird idiosyncrasies, etc.

Currently, the following contests are supported:

- [ELMO](https://web.evanchen.cc/elmo/index.html)
- [Shortlist](http://www.imo-official.org/problems.aspx)
- [IMO](https://web.evanchen.cc/problems.html#tstst)
- [EGMO](https://egmo.org)
- [RMM](https://rmms.lbi.ro/rmm2023/index.php?id=home)
- [TST](https://web.evanchen.cc/problems.html#tst)
- [TSTST](https://web.evanchen.cc/problems.html#tstst)
- [USAMO and JMO](https://web.evanchen.cc/problems.html#usamo) (USA)

May add in more stuff later.
